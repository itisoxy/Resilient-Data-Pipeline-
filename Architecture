Objective:
Build a streaming data pipeline to simulate fintech fraud events, process them in real-time, and monitor pipeline health with Prometheus and Grafana.

| Producer  | --->  | Kafka  | --->  | Consumer |
+-----------+       +--------+       +----------+
                                      |
                                      v
                                +------------+
                                | DynamoDB   |
                                +------------+

Monitoring:
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from Producer & Consumer
- Grafana dashboards visualize metrics and errors
Portfolio Project: Resilient Data Pipeline for FinTech Analytics

Producer: generates simulated fintech fraud events

Kafka: message broker for event streaming (KRaft or Confluent)

Consumer: processes events and stores in DynamoDB

Monitoring: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards

Alerting: designed to detect pipeline failures or lag (not implemented live due to Docker network issues)
